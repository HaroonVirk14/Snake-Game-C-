# Snake Game

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Snake game in C++.

## Introduction

This Snake game is a console-based application where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating fruits to grow longer. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or with the walls, depending on the selected game mode.

## Features

- Two game modes:
  - Mode 1: Snake can pass through walls and appear on the opposite side.
  - Mode 2: Collision with walls results in game over.
- Score tracking: Players earn points by eating fruits.
- Responsive controls: Players can control the snake's direction using the WASD keys.
- Simple ASCII graphics: Game elements are represented by characters on the console screen.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the `snake_game.cpp` file using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable.
4. Use the following controls to move the snake:
   - W: Move up
   - A: Move left
   - S: Move down
   - D: Move right
   - X: Exit the game
5. Try to eat as many fruits as possible without colliding with walls or the snake's body.
